My name is Layla and I am a .NET developer! I also identify as a woman and that is less common combination in the wider .NET community.
In January 2021, I decided to host an entire year of female speakers at the meetup group I co-organise, .NET Milton Keynes.

I am often asked how to find women .NET speakers so I decided to create the #WomenOfDotNet Initiative, dedicated to all the wonderful .NET individuals that also identify as women!

I have since been joined by an international team of passionate women and allies, all eager to see the .NET community grow, in a good way!

> ## Our Mission
> #WomenOfDotNet is a growing community of developers who identify as women and their allies. It is our mission to enrich the .NET community at large and encourage women of all ages, backgrounds, and experiences to come together and create a welcoming, enriching, and inclusive environment for everyone. Whether you want to learn, mentor, catch up over a cuppa, or just plain geek out over the latest tech, there is a place for you in our community.
