### About me

Hi!
I'm a Microsoft MVP in AI. I'm passionate about ML, .NET, C#, .NET, Azure and cross-platform development. 
I'm a public speaker, hackathon volunteer and a co-organiser of the Boston Azure user group.
I'm holding a master degree in Information Technology. In my free time, I like dancing, traveling and practicing aerial fitness.
