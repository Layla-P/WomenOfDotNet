### About me
##### **I am a Recruiter (a nice one) at iO Associates**

I work in .Net Recruitment across Scotland, I absolutely love getting involved and hosting MeetUp events and I am slowly but surely learning to code myself. You can talk to me about jobs, coding, meetups, coffee, cycling and DOGS!
