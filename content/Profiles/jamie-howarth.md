### About me
##### Freelance software consultant specialising in ASP.NET/Core, Umbraco & scalable web applications. ASPInsider, speaker, author & mentor.

I'm a freelance ASP.NET consultant, specialising in content management systems such as Umbraco, Sitecore and Kentico, with a broad variety of outside interests as to how technology interacts with our society at large, in law, politics and ethical oversight of the tech industry.

I've spoken at multiple .NET community events and conferences regarding website performance, especially on techniques to measure metrics for ASP.NET-based websites and how to improve performance metrics for responsive websites.  

I'm also in the process of developing my own tech startup, specialising in helping businesses and public authorities comply with data protection laws across numerous countries, including the EU, the USA and Brazil. 

In my spare time I am a fierce mental health advocate, as I have autism, ADHD and bipolar disorder.
