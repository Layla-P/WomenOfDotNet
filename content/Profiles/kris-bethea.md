### About me

##### I am a web developer and software engineer, lifelong Whovian, empath, avid book reader, introvert and total geek.

 I designed my first website in the 90s by viewing source and borrowing what I liked and making it my own. Since then I earned a degree in computer science and have worked my way through the ranks as a Sitecore developer.
 I am now a senior software developer for a non-profit organization.

 I love coding .NET and taking training, classes and attending conferences to stay on top of technology.
 I'm currently learning MAUI and taking what I am learning to create an app for empaths.
