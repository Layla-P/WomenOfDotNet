### About me

##### Hi, I'm KrisðŸ¤— I'm a techie and a Potterhead. I live in Norway, love coding, cats, coffee and good books. With Animal Welfare at heartðŸ˜»ðŸŒˆ

I am working as a Software Architect in Oslo and driving several exciting tech projects that support digitalization journey in public and private sector, minimizing bureaucracy and making citizensâ€™ life easier. My main area of interest is secure and sustainable cloud native application development with specialization in Microsoft technologies like Azure and dotNET.

In 2022 I've become a Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) in Microsoft Azure category and I'm totally over the moon about this recognition - for many more years of giving back to the tech community!

As a person I love learning new things and sharing my journey and experiences with others. My biggest passion is tech and my goal is to inspire other developers to code with sustainability and security in mind by spreading my knowledge and experience. My goal is also to be a female coder role model that can inspire and motivate all the beautiful girls and ladies out there to join the world of tech! ðŸ’–

I strongly believe that contributing to making this world a better place by volunteering is something all of us should consider doing, therefore being a volunteer is a big part of my life.

I am also an active supporter of sustainability, including sustainable software engineering, and animal welfare.ðŸŒ±
