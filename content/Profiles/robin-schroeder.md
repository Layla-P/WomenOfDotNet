### About me
##### **I like computer stuff**

I started writing code in 1999, when dinosaurs roamed the earth and the web was the wild, wild west. More or less completely self taught, I started out in Java/JSP/Java Beans. I also did a fair amount of programming in VBA/Microsoft Access, paired with a healthy amount of SQL Server and database management. I married a Microsoft developer in 2008 and made as pretty big leap from Java to C# so that we could actually write code together. In 2012, I fell in love with Windows 8 Metro apps (shhh... don't tell anyone!) and then puddle jumped over to Xamarin in 2015. For the last few years, I have been specializing in BLE/IoT communications in Xamarin/Xamarin.Forms and Azure IoT. 

I like to tinker with different hardware and dev boards. I really love how Bluetooth Mesh works.  

I try to deliver at least one talk per year. In May 2021, I gave a talk on Bluetooth at the Minnesota Developers Conference, virtually. 

I served as the technical editor of a Packt book on Visual Studio in 2020.

On Friday nights during the school year, I am a co-instructor at the Fox Valley Girls Coding Club. Basically, we  write fun little games in HTML/JS/CSS, python or Unity, or whatever the girls are interested in. We have been meeting virtually since the pandemic began. In past years, the girls have participated in local hackathons. [foxvalleygirlscodingclub.com](https://foxvalleygirlscodingclub.com/)

I am also a mom to two pretty cool teenagers and a golden retriever. I like to crochet and play acoustic guitar.
