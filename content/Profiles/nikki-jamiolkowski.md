### About me
##### **Full stack DotNet developer creating enterprise-grade platform tools**

I started my coding career writing order-fulfillment software for steel companies, and then moved over to the healthcare industry. Now, I'm working in the financial industry building platform tools for my fellow developers.

In my spare time, I'm playing a video game, chasing around my pets and kids, or enjoying the sunshine.
