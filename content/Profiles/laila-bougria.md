### About me

Here's 5 things about me:

1. I was born and raised in Belgium, but I have Spanish and Moroccan roots
2. Butterflies make me smile
3. I speak 5 languages, excluding the coding languages ;-)
4. A great teacher spotted some coding talent in me and I never looked back
5. I enjoy jumping on the trampoline with my kids, knitting, working out, and vitamin sea
