### About me
##### **Live Coder, Microsoft MVP, GitHub Star, Director - .NET Foundation**
I am a Developer Advocate at VMware Tanzu. I am a Live Coder on Twitch, a Microsoft MVP, a GitHub Star, a former director on the board of the .NET Foundation, and the founder of the #WomenOfDotNet Initiative!

I am an international conference speaker, where I strive on making tech understandable for all. I love using analogies to teach as everyone has a different way of learning.

I am passionate about making the .NET community an awesome and welcoming place for everyone. Please reach out via contact form below to chat about collaboration with me.

I love sharing knowledge whilst having fun. No question is stupid and beginners are always welcome.
