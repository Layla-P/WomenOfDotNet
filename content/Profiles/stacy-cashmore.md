### About me
##### Microsoft MVP, Lego Builder on Twitch, Tech Explorer DevOps

I'm Tech Explorer DevOps for Omniplan, in Amsterdam. I spend my days helping the teams improve - technically and themselves, and looking into new technology.

I love speaking, either in person or virtually, on topics ranging from how we develop software as a team, to live coding demonstrating different technologies and also about my mental health. The last to try and remove the stigma that is unfortunately still attached to this topic.

I also help organise the ServerlessDays Amsterdam meetup - spreading the word about serverless technologies and how to use them to build better software.

Outside of software I love building Lego, and spend an hour or two each week live building different models on my Twitch channel.
