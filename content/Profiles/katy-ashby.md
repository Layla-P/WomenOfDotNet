### About me
Hi! 👋 

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 4+ years experience in building products with C# and .NET within the telephony industry 📞 and most recently, food supply chain industry 🥙.

I've worked on monolithic and microservice products using .NET framework and .NET Core.

I've spoken at alumni events to graduates looking to start a career in tech. 👩‍🎓

On Twitter I like to share what I've learned throughout my career as a Software Engineer and Technical Leader. 🐤

More recently I've turned my interest to learning about frontend development and I'm learning React. 👩‍💻

C# will always be my first love though! ❤
