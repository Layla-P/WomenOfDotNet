### About me
##### Program Manager on .NET and Visual Studio at Microsoft
Hi! I'm a pm on the .NET and Visual Studio team. My focus is the testing experience in Visual Studio. You may recognize me from plenty of YouTube and Channel9 videos on .NET, C#, and general Visual Studio goodness. In addition to an unruly enthusiasm for technology, I love reading and playing beat saber!
