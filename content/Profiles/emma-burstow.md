### About me

##### Director of Devloper Relations @Umbraco HQ - .NET Developer and Microsoft MVP
I'm a developer advocate who found her way into the role because I couldn't stop talking about tech with folk who would listen. Ex-high school teacher (which explains some of it) and a passionate advocate for learners in the industry. I am delighted to have found a day job where I get to code and build but also work with others in the wider .NET community. I am a regular attendee at meetups and conferences - virtually and in-person, when that's possible. I don't work well in a vacuum so community is a way of life for me - it keeps me excited about what I do at my desk. 

My hobby is trying new hobbies and as an adult who was diagnosed with ADHD in 2020, I like to use my enthusiasm for novelty to pick up and play with new bits of tech and connect with others along the way. As a result, each time I write about myself I list a new interest but one that's stuck around a while is open water swimming. My streak on my Danish language learning app is in three figures too. 

### Contact

I'm always happy to meet new people in the .NET community so feel free to find me and connect if I've said something that chimes with you.
